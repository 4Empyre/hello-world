Hello World on GitHub
I have self taught most of my computer knowledge. Taking computers apart at the age of 10 and building the best possible version with all the parts. Then building my first gaming PC a couple years later and self-diagnosing hardware issues upon delivery taking steps to fix the newly built PC. After highschool I took on a job as an IT Administrator for a small business. Now I am on a new career path to computer programming.
I'm very excited, and hope to get some creations out for the world to enjoy and benefit from.
